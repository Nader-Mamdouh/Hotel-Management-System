# Hotel Management System

The Hotel Management System is a C++ program that allows users to manage hotel reservations and perform various operations related to room booking, guest information, and hotel administration.
The system utilizes circular queues implemented with linked lists, binary search trees (BST), and a single linked list for efficient data management.
## Data Structures Used

- Circular Queue: The circular queue data structure is used to manage the room reservation system. It allows efficient insertion and deletion of room reservations, ensuring that reservations are processed in a first-come, first-served manner.

- Binary Search Tree (BST): The BST data structure is employed to store and manage guest information. It allows efficient searching, insertion, and retrieval of guest records based on their unique identification numbers.

- Single Linked List: The single linked list data structure is used to store and manage employee records. It enables efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal of employee information.

## Features

- User authentication: The system includes a login mechanism to authenticate the hotel staff before accessing the management functionalities.

- Room reservation: Hotel staff can reserve rooms for guests, specifying the guest details and room preferences.

- Check-in and check-out: Guests can be checked in and checked out of their reserved rooms, updating the room availability status.

- Room status: The system provides information on the current status of rooms, including availability, occupancy, and room types.

- Billing and payment: Guests' bills are calculated based on the room rates and additional services provided during their stay. Payment information can be recorded.

- Guest information: The system maintains a database of guest information, including personal details, contact information, and stay history.

- Employee management: The system includes an employee management feature, utilizing a single linked list data structure to store and manage employee records. This allows adding, updating, and removing employee information.
